## Improvements to be done with more time in hand

- Implement the calendar view
- Fix spacing exactly according to the design
- Add pagination
- Implementation of the search bar 
- Improve the mobile view

## Additional Notes
 
- Since I used the latest version of Material UI (v5), I had to spend time reading the documentation.
- I had to create dummy data, which took some extra time as well.
